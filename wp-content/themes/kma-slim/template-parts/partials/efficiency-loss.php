            <h2 class="title is-1">Why Use KoolMaxx?</h2>
            <p>Why Use KoolMaxx? KoolMaxx is an additive that removes oil fouling from your air conditioning system. Oil fouling will cause a loss of about 7% efficiency in the first year of an air conditioner’s life, up to a loss of 30% to 40% efficiency over time. By removing oil fouling, the refrigerant in your air conditioner flows throughout the system without being restricted – this leads to a more efficient system that provides cooler air while extending compressor life.</p>
